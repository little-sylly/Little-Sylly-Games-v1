# Deferred Work

**On-demand — not auto-loaded.** The running list of known-but-not-yet-done work: code divergences,
retest backlogs, and audit items that are deliberately parked rather than forgotten. Newest section on top.
Tick items off here; promote anything architectural into `decision-log.md`.

> Replaces `docs/fable-fix-plan.md`, which `logic-engine.md` pointed at but which no longer exists in the repo.

## Retest backlog — the older games (added 1 Aug 2026)

**Owner's note:** the suite has picked up a lot of cross-cutting change since the early games shipped —
the Stack layout sweep, the Motion Standard + reduced-motion block (SW v148), and the asset-pack render seams
and core art tier. The early games were built before most of it and have not been replayed since.

**Scope:** every game shipped before the current phase, replayed on a real device — not a code audit, an
actual play. Priority order is roughly oldest-first, since they have accumulated the most drift:
LI5 → Great Minds → Secret Signals → JEC → YGI → LTTP → Natural Selection → Deep-Sea Deploy → Bailed →
Group Therapy → The Bluff → Pass → Net-Trace → Fruit Salad → Counting Sheep → Flawless.

**What to check per game** (beyond "does it still play"):
- Reduced motion — DevTools → Rendering → emulate `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; nothing should travel,
  and nothing should be left stranded on screen (the `animationend`-cleanup trap, see `ui-style.md` § Motion Standard).
- Stack compliance — any screen looking sparse or edge-pinned that is **not** on the legacy `h-screen`
  whitelist in `ui-style.md` is a new bug.
- The per-game values in `ui-style.md` § Per-Game Reference actually match what renders.
- Sylly Mode reachable and working (all 17 games have one).

**Log findings** in each game's `docs/implementation-notes/[abbr]-implementation-notes.md` as they surface,
not in a batch at the end.

## Smaller flagged items

- **GTH Play CTA contains an emoji** ("Start the Session 🛋️"), violating the "CTA start-game buttons must not
  contain emoji" rule in `ui-style.md` § Settings Card Standard. Reconcile at the GTH retest.
- **FLW how-to step labels** use inline `style="color:#E879A8"` where every other custom-colour game uses its
  `[abbr]-label` class (PKO uses `pko-label`). Cosmetic consistency only — it renders correctly.
- **`docs/archive/` is not empty** — it holds `phase-audit-2026-06-30-snapshot.md`, while `CLAUDE.md` describes
  the directory as empty by design with snapshots kept out-of-repo. Either move that file to the external
  archive or amend the claim.
